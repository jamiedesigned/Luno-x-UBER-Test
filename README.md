# Luno-x-UBER-Test

This project was very enjoyable! Thank you for your time and considering me for this role.
ALL code was written by me. 
I have not used any styles or markup from the live pages (except a few assets and the hex codes).

I have created an XD file with all the elements from the current live page. I find it helpful to have a page where I can put all my assets and a design to print so that I can work from it and annotate it to think and plan the mark up.

** responsive needs some work to make it better from a UX point of view such as font size, alignment and size of menu etc. However I would be able to amend these with media queries with another hour or so.

- I created a loader effect which simulates written text for the first few milliseconds of the page load. I think it is quite stylish and in keeping with Luno using js.

- I created the menu from the live site with all relevant hover effects.

- created the four steps effect using js.

- i created the scroll header chnage using js.

- I had to recreate and edit a lot of the assets from the live sites using photoshop and illustartor in order to make my assets quicker to use for example adding a gradient and circles effect to a background image rather than using an ::after overlay.  

I have used a sass compiler for my css. I feel I could made my sass a bit DRYer as I repeated a few styles. 

I am looking ofrward to your feedback on this test. 

WHAT I THINK NEEDS IMPROVING
** The copy needs improving, but as it was a coding test I didnt put as much thought into it At this time. **
** The anchors dont have hrefs as I didnt have to time and I wasnt sure where to link them too **
** All css and markup was done by me and by eye so there may be some deviation from offical brand guideline such as font family and padding etc. This would of course be easy to improve if I had the brand guidelines to work from :) **
** The footer is just a screenshot background image. **

Kind regards
J
